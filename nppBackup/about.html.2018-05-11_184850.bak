<h1 class="red">About H.O.P.E. House</h1>
<br>
<h2 class="black">What We Do</h2>
<p>Formed in October 2011, H.O.P.E. has been a USDA Approved member since 2013, which qualifies us to participate
in Special Nutrition Program for “Women, Infants, and Children” (WIC). We currently support over 400 households
representing more than 1400 men, women, and children in need.</p>
<br>

<p>At H.O.P.E. House, we look to help anyone who walks through our doors. We welcome each client and create strong bonds with
them and their families. To be eligible for some our services, new clients are asked to register to demonstrate that they are need of
financial assistance. Once qualified, each client is entitled to receive a monthly bag filled with staple grocery items from
the Contra Costa Food Bank. A client with more than 6 members in their household is entitled to 2 bags. Clients are also allowed to
return once a week to receive extra food from supplies stocked on shelves and in crates at our facility. We also have a closet of gently
used clothing for those in need.</p>
<br>

<br><h2 class="black">Who We Are</h2>
<p>Some of our volunteers were once clients who have been able to carry themselves out of their difficult time through our services.
Now they want to give back to the community by offering other people the services that formerly was offered to them. About 20 volunteers
make up the HOPE house team.</p> 
<br>
<p>Occasionally, H.O.P.E. House also receives as assistance from Liberty High School students earning community volunteer credits. Liberty also
provides volunteers that are participants in the Gateway Program. This is a project run by Liberty Adult Education that serves
18-22 year-old students with disabilities. Serving at H.O.P.E. House is an ideal way to engage these students in the community-based instruction
and community-awareness activities that are foundational elements in their Gateway curriculum.</p>

<br><h2 class="black">Why We Help</h2>
<p>
The Bible says that by serving these dear people we are actually serving Him because Jesus described the final judgment in terms of service:</p>
<br>
<p><i>“‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in,
or needing clothes and clothe you…?’ The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of
mine, you did for me.’”</i></p>
<br>
<p>With that kind of vision, we might imagine the work of HOPE House not only to be worth whatever time and resources we invest in it, but there’s
absolutely nothing on earth we could do with our time that would be more valuable or ultimately rewarding.</p>
